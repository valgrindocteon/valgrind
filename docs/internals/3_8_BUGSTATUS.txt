Bugs reported after the release of 3.8.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file lists bugs that were reported after 3.8.0 was released, both
in 3.8.0 and trunk, and that have not been closed.  Bugs that have
been closed as "fixed" are listed in the top level NEWS file instead.
In other words they get listed here first and moved to NEWS if they
get fixed.

This file also tracks commits & fixes that should be pushed to the 3.8
branch.
